# Snake

This is an ncurses implementation of the classic snake game.
Navigate around the board using **hjkl**, **wasd** or **arrow keys**.
Going off the edge wraps around.

Your score at the end is simply the length of the snake, the starting 
length of the snake is one.

I have not yet implemented a way to set the 
speed of the snake. I may or may not implement this when I feel like it.
